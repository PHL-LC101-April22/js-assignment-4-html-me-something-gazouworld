               I was born in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. Owen Sound is famous as 'The Home of Bobby Orr'.

            <h2>Skunk Hollow, Nova Scotia</h2>
            <p>
               In a rash descision, my parents decided to move us into the woods of Nova Scotia, Canada. We built our
               own log cabin and lived without plumbing or electricity for several years.

               <figcaption>
                  Behind us is the log cabin we built in and area of Nova Scotia we called Skunk Hollow. We were so far
                  in the woods that the area had no official name. I think we saw " Skunk Hollow" on a surveryors map
                  but I don't know if that story is true.

               I auditioned and was accepted to the Dalhousie University Theatre School. I learned how to overunciate
               and how to use an inappropriate ammount of makeup.

                  I'm so old I couldn't find pictures of myself on the Schools website. I used this one because they
                  look to be as bad at acting as I was back then though they are wearing less makeup.

            <p>
               I got my first professional acting job in Newfoundland! While I was there a guy asked me if I wanted to
               work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I politly turned him down and said I was going to try my luck in film
               and television in Vancouver.

            <p>
               I was a glorified extra for a few months on the show 21 Jump Street. Then they moved me up to 'special
               status' extra. I'm still not sure what that means. But I hung in there long enough to get a speaking
               line. I can't find the episode so you'll have to trust me that I was in it.

            <p>
               I had loftier ambitions than film and tv. Translated: Paul couldn't get another gig. So I remembered that
               offer to come work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I took the leap and went to Hedgerow Theatre Company.

                  Well it wasn't actually in Philadelphia - more like the suburbs - and it was a quaint old grist mill
                  with amazing history.
