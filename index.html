            <p style="font-size: 30;">
               In a rash descision, my parents decided to move us into the woods of Nova Scotia, Canada. We built our
               own log cabin and lived without plumbing or electricity for several years.

               <figcaption style="font-size: 30px;">
                  Behind us is the log cabin we built in and area of Nova Scotia we called <b>Skunk Hollow</b>. We were
                  so far
                  in the woods that the area had no official name. I think we saw " Skunk Hollow" on a surveryors map
                  but I don't know if that story is true. Also, the child in the left of the photo - no one in our
                  family knows who this is.

            <p style="font-size: 30px;">
               I auditioned and was accepted to the <b>Dalhousie University Theatre School</b>. I learned how to
               overunciate
               and how to use an inappropriate ammount of makeup.

                  I'm so old I couldn't find pictures of myself on the Schools website. I used this one because they
                  look to be as bad at acting as I was back then though they are wearing less makeup.

            <p style="font-size: 30px;">
               I got my first professional acting job in <b>Newfoundland!</b> While I was there a guy asked me if I
               wanted to
               work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I politly turned him down and said I was going to try my luck in film
               and television in Vancouver.

            <p style="font-size: 30px;">
               I was a glorified extra for a few months on the show <b>21 Jump Street</b>. Then they moved me up to
               <i>'special status'extra</i>. I'm still not sure what that means. But I hung in there long enough to get
               a speaking
               line. I can't find the episode so you'll have to trust me that I was in it.

            <p style="font-size: 30px;">
               I had loftier ambitions than film and tv. Translated: Paul couldn't get another gig. So I remembered that
               offer to come work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I took the leap and went to <b>Hedgerow Theatre
                  Company</b>.

                  Well it wasn't actually in <em>Philadelphia</em> - more like the suburbs - and it was a quaint old
                  grist mill
                  with amazing history.

               I'm still staying active in theatre but I thought I'd try my hand a <b>coding</b>. I made the word
               'coding' <strong>bold</strong> to show our intructors that I learned one of the 6,0000.00000 html tags.
               The word 'bold', however is html tag 'strong' for our visually impared users. <br> I'll let you know how
               my coding journey
               goes.
